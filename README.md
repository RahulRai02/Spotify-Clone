I am Rahul Rai a B.Tech 2nd year UG in CSE at IIT Gandhinagar
This project was created by me mainly to teach myself Javascript. Since the point of this project was not to make great UI/UX design choices using CSS, i chose to make a 
clone for a well known application Spotify. In my current project only a few number of songs can be added. The operations like Play, pause, seek are all available.

Technology used : HTML, CSS, Javascript


  To run the clone, just open the Repo in any IDE and run it on live server.

Thank you
